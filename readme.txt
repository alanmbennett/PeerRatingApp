to run the program open up the project folder in ruby mine and configure the ruby interpereter so ruby mine can run it.
next is to run the Peer_Sin.rb file.
Then load up the local host, with either the / or /login to access the pages, from there you can create new account or login.

We were unable to get any file uploading or midification to work so all file uploads allow you to select a file and will bring you back to the page as if it was uploaded.
You can sucessfully download a File which would have been the report If we could have gotten it to work. It also was causing errors with allowing us to name it so it downloads with no name or type but it is the csv that is in files insde the project.

Sometimes a SQLite3 BusyException (database locked) will happen, we were unable to find a consistent fix. If you rerun the program, it should work after that.
